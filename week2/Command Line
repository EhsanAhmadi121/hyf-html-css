*How to create a hidden file and how to display it using ls command?

First we make a folder as a name of Week2:                $ mkdir Week2                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                  
To change directory:                                      $ cd Week2   

To create a hidden file:                                  $ echo 'this is a hidden file' > .Test                                                    
                                                          
To display the hidden file:                               $ ls -a

**How to create multiple nested directories with one mkdir command?

To create multiple nested directories with one mkdir:     $ mkdir -p Hack/Your/Future/with/Foocoding/And/Have/fun

***Execute following commands terminal:

                                                          $ echo "test" > fun
                                                          $  echo "another test" >> fun
                                                          $  wc -c fun
Verify number of characters in the file:                  18 fun

How would you use echo command, so that output would be: testanother test?
              
                                                          $ echo -n "test" > fun
                                                          $ echo "another test" >> fun
                                                          $ cat fun
                                                          testanother test
